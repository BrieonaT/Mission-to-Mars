### Project Overview

The intent of this project is to help a client named Robin, who dreams of working at NASA. Robin aims to gather data about the mission to Mars from multiple sites across the internet and collect it in a single location. She plans to build an automated webscraping app to update the data when new information comes out. In this project, we were tasked with helping Robin develop out the web app and connect it to a mongo database.

Initially, we were tasked with webscraping for the latest headlines of Mars news, a featured image and Mars facts. In the challenge however, we were tasked with adding in a scraping function for the full resolution images and titles of the hemispheres of Mars, along with adding it to the Flask webpage and MongoDataBase. 

### Future Integration
A future way to improve or edit this repository would to be able to make it able to be used in GitHub's 'Pages' feature. This would allow people to not have to download the repository or have much technology expertise in order to view and play with the software.
